About tissueloc
========

`tissueloc <https://github.com/PingjunChen/TissueLocalizer>`_ is a python-based package used for whole slide pathology image tissue localization.

There are two main functions in this package:

1. Load the whole slide image from low level, which is set according to the maximum width or height that the loaded image could own.

2. Locate tissue regions through a series of image processing procedures.

This whole slide tissue localization is entirely based on basic image processing algorithms, which is extremely fast and could act as a preprocessing step for whole slide image automatic analysis.
