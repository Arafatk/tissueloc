About tissueloc
========

`tissueloc <https://github.com/PingjunChen/TissueLocalizer>`_ is a python-based package used for whole slide pathology image tissue localization.

There are two main functions in this package:

1. Load the whole slide image from low level, which is set according to the maximum width or height that loaded image could be.

2. Locate tissue regions through a series of basic image processing procedures.

This whole slide tissue localization is entirely based on image processing algorithms, which is extremely fast and could be preprocessing step for whole slide image automatic analysis.
